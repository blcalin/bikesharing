## Results and Analysis
### Results
Through our data set and the analysis of Citibike data, we determined the following:
 1. ![Checkout_Times_for_Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109991916/201749216-9df9d2df-48c2-4adc-a4e7-43b91603b82b.png)
The Citibikes usage reaches a top of over 2000 minutes per user.
2. ![Checkout_Times_by_Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109991916/201749577-4b94c07f-7147-4393-aaa2-7e41452416f9.png)
Males are significantly higher users than females/others.

3.![Trips_by_Weekday_per_Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109991916/201749884-30a92e38-442a-425d-ae14-6721fffde96d.png)

Males subscribers are the highest users followed by female subscribers.

## Summary
### Results
Based on the information provided, the following can be determined:
1. Bike Repairs for 1/3 of the Citibikes should be done during non-peak hours around 1-5 am.
2. Male subscribers are the highest users and follow the traditional high use times of travel to and from work.
3. Target market for Citibike should be males needing transportation to work and weekend activities and push for subscribing to the services.

### Additional Queries
Overall, the use of this data can be very helpful for future Citibike analysis. I also observed the following:

Males are more likely to start a trip farther than the main city center of NYC than others.
2. ![User_Type_Starting_Location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109991916/201752113-d3d1d7cd-5c2d-4a43-925b-684b1b2a988a.png)
